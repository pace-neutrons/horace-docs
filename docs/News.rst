\ **Successful JOINT HORACE & SPINW WORKSHOP 21st to 25th JAN 2019**\
*********************************************************************



Another joint `Horace <Horace_Workshop>`__ `SpinW <https://www.psi.ch/spinw/>`__ workshop was held at RAL from 21st to 25th January 2019.

We expect to have another workshop late in 2020 - check here for news.




**New Horace file format**
**************************



From 01/01/2017 Horace installed on the ISIScompute system and available from the download page writes the *sqw* files in a new file format, which enables instrument and sample information to be stored and which is necessary for resolution convolution calculations. All *sqw* files produced by Horace before this date are supported and will be supported into the future. If you produce new *sqw* files using Horace issued after 01/01/2017, you will not be able to work with these files using earlier versions of Horace. To work with these files you need to update your Horace installation. Mexoptions.
