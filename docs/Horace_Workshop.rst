 =Horace & SpinW Workshop - 21st to 25th January 2019=

\ **Back again by popular demand!**

\ **In association with SpinW!**

Another training course on how to get the most out of the Horace software package will be held, and once again it will be a joint workshop with the `SpinW <https://www.psi.ch/spinw>`__ team. The course will be split into two parts, with 2 days spent on Horace and 2.5 days spent on SpinW. Participants may attend either or both of the two workshops.


Where
=====



The workshop will be held at the `ISIS neutron source <http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/>`__, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, U.K. . Accommodation is available (and already booked) for all participants at the on-site `Ridgeway House guesthouse <http://www.stfc.ac.uk/about-us/where-we-work/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/ridgeway-house/>`__. Participants must cover their own transportation and accommodation costs - rooms are £60 per night (including all meals).


When
====




\ **Horace part**: 21st - 22nd January 2019.

\ **SpinW part**: 23rd - 25th January 2019.


Registration
============



The course is **free**. `Please register HERE <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcp7oqe5VxwGny09kjrSFcCBSNS-WjOfWXkmNq0RHU9WItUw/viewform>`__.

The deadline for registration is 09:000 GMT on Monday 10th December 2018. Participation is limited to 20 places for both courses. On the registration site you will be asked about your reasons for attending the course(s) - in the event of oversubscription we will use these answers to determine places. Priority will be given to PhD students whose thesis work will make use of these codes, and to scientists who are planning or have already done time-of-flight INS experiments.


Topics
======




Horace course
*************



The course will cover all aspects of Horace.

- Planning an experiment
- Visualising data
- Performing corrections on your data
- Data treatment (symmetrisation, etc)
- Fitting
- "Ask the expert" session at the end, to allow you to discuss specific issues with the developers


SpinW course
************



- Introduction to magnetic structures and linear spin wave theory
- Internal data structure of SpinW and advanced data manipulations
- Handling complex magnetic structures
- Symmetry analysis
- Finding the right magnetic ground state
- Fitting inelastic neutron scattering data (powder, single crystal)
- New features



Course prerequisites
====================



It is expected that participants will have encountered Horace and/or SpinW in their work already.

It is **imperative that participants are familiar with Matlab**. A working knowledge of Matlab is expected, and the courses will not be beneficial to you without this. Bringing a laptop is not necessary as we will provide a Windows PC to everybody. However you can also bring your own laptop if you have Matlab (R2014a or later for Horace, R2017b or later for SpinW) preinstalled.
