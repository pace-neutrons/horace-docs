 Some users may not have sufficient computing power available (see `System Requirements <Download_and_setup#System_requirements>`__) to run Horace. With this is in mind we have installed Horace on the "Melehan", "Rutherford" and "Chadwick" Linux servers at Isis. If you need to use these machines for your data analysis, then please get in touch with the local contact for your experiment, or `Horace Help <mailto:horacehelp@stfc.ac.uk>`__ for more information. General_disclaimer 20080929123511 Horace has only been tested on a limited number of systems and cannot be guaranteed to work on machines different from these. See `system requirements <Download_and_setup#System_Requirements>`__ for details.
